In early 2019 I FOIAed the FBI for details on allegations of backdoor installed in the IPSEC stack in 2010, [originally discussed by OpenBSD developers](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=129236621626462). I got an interesting and unexpected responsive record: https://muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/foia-fbi-openbsd-70084/

The record I was provided by the FBI was created Sept. 2002, and details a separate investigation into an operation tiled 'OPERATION 0DAY COMPUTER INTRUSIONS' To my knowledge there are no other public agency records available regarding this. There are a lot of redactions here, but it looks like the focus here might have been an exploit that lead also to [an infamous old OpenSSH vuln](https://web.archive.org/web/20080622172542/www.iss.net/threats/advise123.html).

This record is also labelled To: COUNTERTERRORISM and requests "assistance from Legates Australia and Canada"
