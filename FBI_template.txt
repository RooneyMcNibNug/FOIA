To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:

Records relating to or mentioning <SUBJECT MATTER HERE>.

Please conduct a thoprough search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices - for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. 

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.
