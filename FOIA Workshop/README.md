Here are some slides for a "FOIA 101" workshop I've done. I've created these using reveal.js, a nifty HTML Presentation Framework - https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js

A barebones PDF copy of the slides can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooneyMcNibNug/FOIA/master/FOIA%20Workshop/LPL-FOIA-workshop-2018-OCR.pdf).
