					<h2>Public Records Requests (FOIA) Workshop</h2>

					<h3>What is a Public Records Request?</h3>
					<ul>
  						<li>A tool to obtain data/records from (most) public agencies.</li>
  						<li>i.e., a means to dig into nagging questions you have regarding both local and federal government.</li>
					</ul> 
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is considered a "Public Record"?</h3>
						<p>This can differ from state to state, but you can try for any tangible record created or maintained by government employees. Here is how the Illinois FOIA statute defines a Public Record:</p>
						<small><code>
						    (c) "Public records" means all records, reports, forms, writings, letters, memoranda, books, papers, maps, photographs, microfilms, cards, tapes, recordings, electronic data processing records, electronic communications, recorded information and all other documentary materials pertaining to the transaction of public business, regardless of physical form or characteristics, having been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.
						</small></code>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Who can make a Public Records Request?</h3>
					<ul>
  						<li>On a federal agency level, any U.S. citizen can make a request.</li>
  						<li>On a state agency level, this can vary. Most state agencies allow requests from any U.S. citizen, but some require proof of residency from requesters. </li>
  						<li>There are other restrictions sometimes (inmates).</li>				
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What should I know before filing a Public Records Request?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Research the contact infromation for the agency's FOIA/Public Records department and how to send them a request.</li>
  						<li>Know your state/federal FOIA laws (the more you know, the better).</li>
						<li>Feel free to look at requests made by other groups and individuals for inspiration.</li>
  						<li>Understand that the process can be a long one.</li>
					</ul> 
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The Process</h3>
					<p>1. Write up your request. Be specific enough where the agency can best find your record, but vague enough for capturing as much relevant data as possible.</p>
					</ol>

					<h3>The Process</h3>
						<p>2. After the request is <i>acknowledged</i> by the agency, they have a time limit to respond to the request. They can, however, extend this by some means.</p>

					<h3>The Process</h3>
						<p>3. The waiting game.</p>

					<h3>The Process</h3>
						<p>At this point (after the waiting) a number of things can happen:</p>
  						<p>4a. You will hopefully be endowed with responsive records from the agency.</p>
  						<p>4b. You might get be asked to narrow your records.</p>
  						<p>4c. You might have your request outright denied.</p>
